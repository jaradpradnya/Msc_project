# Hydrogen Production
A repository for the data and documentation of my Master of microbiology thesis on hydrogen production.
<br>
<br>
<b>Project summary:</b>
<br>
<p>This study investigates a novel and sustainable method of hydrogen energy production using a ammonia generated from human urine. Urease enzyme, extracted from pigeon pea <i>(Cajanus cajan)</i>, is used to hydrolyze urea present in urine, releasing ammonia. The ammonia is then electrolyzed using low-cost electrodes (copper cathode, graphite anode) under a low voltage electric current to 
produce hydrogen gas. The project highlights a biocoupled- electrolysis approach to hydrogen fuel, 
reducing reliance on fossil fuels and energy-intensive processes. </p>

<b>Discussion</b>
<ul>
<li>Urease-based hydrolysis was efficient using pigeon pea extract, indicating potential for 
low-cost biocatalysts.</li>
<li>Electrolysis of ammonia at low voltage with basic metal electrodes successfully produced 
hydrogen.</li>
<li>Energy requirement was significantly lower (~70%) than water electrolysis.</li>
<li>Limitation: Catalyst fouling due to CO<sub>x</sub> intermediates, requiring more stable 
long-term systems.
</ul>

<b>Conclusion:</b>
<br>
<ul>
<li> The project demonstrated a successful biocatalyzed method to extract ammonia from human urine 
and use it to produce hydrogen via electrolysis.</li>

especially in developing regions.
